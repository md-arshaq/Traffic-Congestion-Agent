Adverse weather conditions significantly reduce the effective capacity of road networks. Precipitation such as rain or snow decreases pavement friction, leading drivers to naturally increase their following distances and reduce travel speeds for safety. This voluntary reduction in flow rate creates a cumulative delay effect that ripples through the network, often resulting in heavy congestion even when traffic volume is not at peak levels.

Visibility impairments caused by fog or heavy precipitation further exacerbate these delays. Drivers tend to react more slowly to changes in the traffic stream, increasing the time gaps between vehicles. Studies consistently show that severe weather events can reduce traffic speeds by a significant margin and increase accident risks, which in turn leads to secondary congestion due to lane blockages.

The psychological impact on drivers during severe weather cannot be understated. Anxiety levels rise, leading to more erratic behavior for some and overly cautious driving for others. This variance in driving styles creates turbulence in the traffic stream, increasing the likelihood of phantom traffic jams where flow creates compression waves without any physical obstruction.

"Black ice" and sudden freeze events present unique challenges because the danger is often invisible until a vehicle loses traction. The sudden loss of control for even a single vehicle can block multiple lanes, causing instantaneous gridlock. Pre-treatment of roads with brine and efficient salting operations are critical proactive measures, but they cannot entirely negate the capacity reduction caused by the physical conditions.

Long-term climate resilience planning now requires traffic models to account for more frequent extreme weather events. Drainage systems must be designed to handle flash floods to prevent road submergence, which is a total capacity failure. Integrating real-time weather data into variable speed limit signs allows traffic managers to lower speed limits proactively, potentially smoothing flow and preventing the crash-induced congestion that typically follows sudden storms.
