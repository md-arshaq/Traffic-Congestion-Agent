Urban traffic patterns exhibit distinct usage spikes primarily driven by workforce commuting habits. The most significant congestion typically occurs during the morning window, when residents travel from residential areas to commercial or industrial districts, and the evening window, when this flow reverses. These periods are characterized by high vehicle density that often exceeds the design capacity of major arterial roads.

During these peak hours, traffic flow becomes unstable, meaning that even minor disturbances can cause stop-and-go waves that persist long after the initial cause is removed. Understanding these predictable surges is crucial for signal timing and capacity management, as historical data shows consistent recurring congestion during these specific timeframes. Mitigation strategies often focus on spreading this demand over a wider time window.

School zones introduce a secondary, sharper peak that often overlaps with the general morning commute but clears earlier in the afternoon. This specific traffic flow is highly localized and rigid in its timing, creating concentrated bottlenecks near educational institutions. Planners must account for this "school run" phenomenon, as it often dictates the critical capacity requirements for residential collector roads.

The concept of "tidal flow" effectively describes the directional imbalance seen during rush hours. In the morning, multiple lanes may be needed for inbound traffic, while the outbound lanes remain relatively empty. Reversible lanes are a common engineering response to this asymmetry, allowing the physical infrastructure to adapt dynamically to the prevailing direction of travel, maximizing the utility of the existing pavement width.

Modern telecommuting trends have begun to soften the rigidity of these traditional peaks. While the core rush hours remain, the "shoulder" periods—just before and after the peak—have seen increased volume as workers opt for flexible schedules. This spreading of the peak can actually improve overall network efficiency, as it lowers the maximum instantaneous demand, keeping flow rates closer to the optimal capacity limit.
