Non-recurring traffic incidents, such as vehicle breakdowns, accidents, or debris on the road, are major contributors to unexpected congestion. Unlike peak hour traffic, which is predictable, these events happen randomly and cause immediate bottlenecks. When a lane is blocked, the available capacity of the road drops disproportionately, creating a bottleneck that severely restricts flow and rapidly builds a queue of idling vehicles.

The impact of a random event often extends beyond the immediate scene, causing gridlock on surrounding diversion routes as drivers seek alternatives. The duration of the disruption depends on both the clearance time and the time required for the accumulated queue to dissipate once the road is cleared. Efficient incident management is therefore statistically more effective at reducing total delay than simply adding more lanes.

"Rubbernecking," where drivers in the opposite or adjacent lanes slow down to look at an incident, significantly spreads the congestion effect. This behavior creates a secondary bottleneck even where no physical obstruction exists. Screens and barriers are sometimes deployed by emergency responders specifically to mitigate this visual distraction and maintain flow in the unaffected lanes.

The concept of "secondary accidents" is a critical danger zone following an initial incident. The sudden queue formation creates a high risk of rear-end collisions for approaching vehicles that may not anticipate the stoppage. Advanced warning systems and queue detection sensors are vital tools in preventing these cascading failure events, which can turn a minor breakdown into a major multi-hour blockade.

Clearance time is the single most critical variable in managing random disruptions. Every minute a lane remains blocked results in exponentially more delays for the system. Rapid response teams, tow trucks on standby, and legislation requiring "steer it, clear it" (moving minor accidents to the shoulder) are all operational strategies designed to minimize this clearance window and restore full capacity as quickly as possible.
