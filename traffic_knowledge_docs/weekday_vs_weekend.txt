Traffic behavior shows a marked difference between weekdays and weekends, reflecting the underlying purpose of travel. Weekdays are dominated by mandatory trips, such as commuting to work and school, resulting in sharp, predictable peaks in the morning and late afternoon. These trips tend to follow fixed routes and schedules, creating repetitive patterns of congestion on major commuter corridors.

In contrast, weekend traffic is driven by discretionary travel, such as shopping, recreation, and social visits. The volume is more evenly distributed throughout the midday hours rather than concentrated in brief rush periods. Furthermore, weekend travel patterns are more spatially dispersed, with higher activity around retail centers, parks, and entertainment venues rather than central business districts, leading to different congestion hot-spots.

Friday afternoons often represent a unique hybrid condition, blending the end of the work commute with the start of weekend recreational travel. This often results in the heaviest congestion of the week, with peak periods starting earlier and lasting longer. Traffic engineers must often run specific signal timing plans for Fridays that differ from the standard Monday-Thursday programs.

Cultural and seasonal factors heavily influence weekend patterns. In summer, routes to beaches or vacation spots may experience "rush hour" levels of congestion on Friday evenings and Sunday nights. Conversely, holidays can turn urban centers into ghost towns while clogging the arterial highways leaving the city. These shifts require adaptive operational strategies rather than static fixed-time control.

The "Sunday Drive" phenomenon, while less common now, still points to a different driver psychology on weekends. Drivers are often less time-sensitive, potentially driving slower and more casually. This can conflict with commercial drivers or those still working, creating friction in the traffic stream. Additionally, weekends often see a higher percentage of unfamiliar drivers in certain areas, leading to more erratic navigation maneuvers.
